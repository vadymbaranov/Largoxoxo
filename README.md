Hi, I’m Vadym Baranov.
👀 I’m interested in Web Development.
🌱 In December 2022 I completed Mate Academy Fullstack course. I have 6 months of professional experience creating Frontend projects.
Additionally in October 2021 I completed Google Data Analytics Certificate. And plan on merging my web development knowledge with data analysis knowledge in future.
💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Frontend/Fullstack projects.
